//*** ExchangeNode data structure ***//

// This is a data structure that models a particular equity in the stock market
// Every trading requests that refer to a stock will be handled by the ExchangeNode
// of that stock. It consists of the stock name, an availability indicator that holds 
// true when there is at least one available trade there, and two TradeHeap objects
// whose purpose is to sort and handle all requests appropriately.

//*** Exchange class ***//

// This class encapsulates a naive version of a Stock Exchange. One can submit trading
// requests to the Stock Exchange, and its the responsibility of the Exchange's matching 
// engine to handle all requests and execute those which are possible.
// As a result, the matching engine is ignited upon opening of the Stock Exchange and 
// continuously runs in the background until the Stock Exchange closes for the day. 
// All remaining requests that are not executed remain in the database (in our case are discarded)
// Due to the high volume of requests in an exchange, we need to protect the submit method
// from two or more brokers (threads) trying to submit at the same time to the exchange. In order
// submission is required, thus we are using STL's mutual exclusion mechanisms and condition variables.
// Additionally, all the matching engine methods are encapsulated (declared private) as its only
// the Exchange's responsibility to execute requests. In a case of a dark pool, that might not hold.
