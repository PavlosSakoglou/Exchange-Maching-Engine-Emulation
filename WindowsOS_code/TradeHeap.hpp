//*** TradeNode data structure ***//

// This data structure holds the trading information of a trade
// and will be treated as a trading entiry from the exchange and the
// matching engine
struct TradeNode {
	Trader*		trader;			// Pointer to a Trader instance to be determined
	Request*	request;		// Pointer to a trading Request instance
	long long	submit_id;		// Timestamp of filing a request in the exchange

	// Default constructor sets the pointers to nullptr, and the id to -1
	TradeNode() : trader(nullptr), request(nullptr), submit_id(-1) {}

	// Parameter constructor for convenience

};

//*** TradeHeap class ***//

// This data structure emulates a priority queue (max heap) 
// where any request that is inserted goes to a position that
// describes its execution priority as per its price. The highest the 
// price, the higher the priority. This holds for both BUY and SELL requests
// Elements to be extracted and executed from the priority queue are always the 
// ones at index 0 i.e. at the head of the priority queue
// The implementation below is in native C++, using a dynamic array of TradeNode type
// and is an alternative of the STL's std::priority_queue, with similar functionality.
// Similar to std::priority_queue, the insertion happens in a sorted manner as per
// the requirements of the Exchange. If two or more elements have the same key value
// (price in our case) then the earlier inserted element has priority i.e. is at a 
// lower index in the queue.
// Another alternative implementation of the below heap -- and perhaps a more efficient one,
// would use a native C doubly linked list (or std::list in case of STL) with similar overloaded
// interface to fit our purposes

	// to this method will only have to look at the class definition instead
	// of searching to the source file for its implementation. The disadvantage
	// is that it might make the compilation process slightly slower since it
