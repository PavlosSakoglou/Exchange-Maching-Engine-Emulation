# Exchange Matching Engine Emulation

This project implements an elementary version of a matching engine in a stock market exchange. It uses data structures and algorithms to describe an efficient system that handles asynchronous BUY and SELL requests from buyers and sellers for a pool of financial instruments (equity in this case). The system fills the requests or keeps them pending as per the availability, and keeps track of all transactions and their timestamp in the order book.
